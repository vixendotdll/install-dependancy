# install-dependancy
installs dependancies from arguments (LINUX ONLY)
i wrote this in a few hours 
its designed for other scripts, to be either molded in them or used by them

## **usage**

chmod +x path/to/install_dependancy.sh
./install_dependancy.sh package_1 package_2 package_3

## **the reason it works**

it checks the operating system of a user and uses the default package manager for that os to install the arguments you give it

## **why**

- error handling
- installing dependancies that usually arent on regular distros
- because i wanted to

## **credits**

- me, i made this
- the contributers of https://github.com/which-distro/os-release/tree/main, because i used some of their work for os discovery
- github, think about what website ur looking at this page on
